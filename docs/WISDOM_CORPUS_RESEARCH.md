## For Sage Coaching Intelligence Platform
### Prepared: January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing 12,397-book Wisdom Corpus and prioritized recommendations for a RAG-optimized coaching knowledge base. The analysis prioritizes **coachee transformation impact** as the #1 criterion, following Jesse's direction.

### Current Corpus Strengths
- Strong foundation in Philosophy (913 books), Literature (689), and Wisdom Traditions (350)
- Good coverage of Ken Wilber (38 books), Joseph Campbell (24), Byron Katie (13), Daniel Goleman (11)
- Solid representation of Brené Brown (8), Pema Chödrön (9), Dan Siegel (9), Tara Brach (7)
- Key coaching texts present: Co-Active Coaching, The Coaching Habit, Coaching for Performance

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Conscious Leadership Framework** - The 15 Commitments authors (Dethmer, Chapman, Klemp) not found by author search
2. **Arbinger Institute works** - Leadership and Self-Deception, The Anatomy of Peace, The Outward Mindset
3. **David Rock/NeuroLeadership** - Your Brain at Work missing
4. **Terry Real's relational work** - Missing entirely
5. **Heath Brothers** - Switch, Made to Stick missing
6. **Thomas Moore's soul work** - Care of the Soul, Soul Mates missing
7. **Key Shadow Work anthologies** - Meeting the Shadow, Romancing the Shadow
8. **Professional Training & Education Texts** - Major gap in foundational textbooks (see new section below)

---

## CRITICAL GAP: PROFESSIONAL TRAINING & EDUCATION TEXTS

This is a significant oversight in the current corpus. A coach or therapist in training would be expected to master foundational academic and practical texts that are largely missing. These provide the theoretical grounding and evidence base that transforms intuitive helping into professional practice.

### Current State:
- **Coaching Training Manuals:** Only 4 handbook-type texts found
- **Psychotherapy Textbooks:** Gerald Corey (gold standard) NOT FOUND
- **Modality-Specific Training:** Most major modalities have 0-2 training texts
- **Evidence-Based Practice:** Prochaska, Norcross, Wampold, Lambert - all missing or minimal
- **Founder/Developer Works:** Some present (Hayes, Beck, Schwartz), many missing (Linehan, Shapiro)

## CORPUS OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### For RAG Performance

1. **Prioritize extraction of frameworks and models:**
   - GROW model (Whitmore)
   - Co-Active model (4 cornerstones)
   - SCARF model (Rock)
   - Choice Map (Adams)
   - Drama Triangle / Empowerment Dynamic
   - RAIN (Brach)
   - The Work (Katie)
   - IFS parts model
   - Attachment styles (secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized)
   - Stages of change (Prochaska)

2. **Create concept embeddings for:**
   - Coaching questions bank
   - Intervention types by situation
   - Metaphors and stories
   - Research findings and citations

3. **Tag entries by:**
   - Coach use case (post-session, prep, in-session, between-session)
   - Coachee situation (stuck, anxious, relationship, career, meaning, etc.)
   - Intervention level (cognitive, emotional, somatic, relational, spiritual)

## FINAL NOTES

The existing corpus is remarkably comprehensive for a 12,397-book collection. The gaps identified are relatively narrow and specific - primarily in:

1. **Applied coaching methodology** (Arbinger, Rock, Adams)
2. **Contemporary relational therapy** (Terry Real, Gottman's practical work)
3. **Shadow work anthologies** (vs. original depth psychology which is well-covered)
4. **Vertical development** (Spiral Dynamics, Kegan/Lahey organizational application)
5. **Organizational culture** (Coyle, Marquet, Wiseman)

The corpus has excellent coverage of:
- Foundational psychology and philosophy
- Meditation and contemplative traditions
- Ken Wilber's integral work
- Joseph Campbell and mythology
- Brené Brown's vulnerability work
- Somatic and trauma-informed approaches
- Positive psychology

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Phase 1 additions (50 books) immediately, as these fill the most critical gaps for coaching application. The current corpus, even without additions, provides a strong foundation - the additions will transform it from excellent to genuinely comprehensive for professional coaching support.
