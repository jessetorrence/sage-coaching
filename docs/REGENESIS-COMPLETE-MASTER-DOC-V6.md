# PART A: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What is ReGenesis?

ReGenesis is not a coaching app. ReGenesis is an **invisible, embedded agentic AI intelligence** that lives inside the tools coaches and coachees already use. There is no new website to learn, no dashboard to check, no additional workflow to adopt.

### The Core Promise
**Zero workflow change, infinite support.**

Session ends → Notes appear → Coach tweaks → Client receives. All without leaving the browser. What used to take 30-45 minutes of post-session admin happens automatically in 5 minutes or less.

### Key Differentiators

| Traditional Coaching Apps | ReGenesis |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Another app to check | Invisible — embedded in existing tools |
| Coach does admin work | AI does admin, coach coaches |
| Data owned by platform | Data sovereign to user |
| Generic AI responses | Writes in coach's voice (powered by Claude) |
| Sessions only | 24/7 coachee companion |
| Guesses about coachee | Pattern recognition across all data |

### Architecture Philosophy

- **Extension-first** — Chrome extension is the daily driver
- **Web app exists** for onboarding, deep dives, settings, demos
- **Mobile apps for ALL user tiers** — Coach, Coachee, and Corporate Admin each have mobile functionality
- **"ReGenesis brings you the screen when you need it. You never go looking for ReGenesis."**

---

# PART B: FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHY & HUMAN CAPACITIES *(NEW in V6)*

*This section captures the deepest foundational thinking that all product decisions must remain in service to. It is not UI copy; it is the philosophical and psychological spine of ReGenesis.*

---

## The Single Sentence That Holds It All (LOCKED)

**"ReGenesis exists to hold memory, reveal patterns, and generate insight—so human presence, compassion, and discernment can lead transformation."**

### Companion Principle (LOCKED)

**"Human intuition and discernment are to be strengthened—not replaced."**

### Core Mission Phrase (LOCKED)

**"Preserve and deepen what is sacred in human-to-human care—while radically expanding access to care itself."**

And: **"Not instead of love, not instead of wisdom — in service of them."**

---

## What This Is Actually For

ReGenesis is not fundamentally a productivity tool, a coaching CRM, or an AI assistant.

It exists to **support human becoming** — without collapsing becoming into optimization, performance, or compliance.

The system is explicitly designed to **serve irreducibly human capacities** that remain essential regardless of how capable AI becomes.

---

## The Three Primary Human Capacities We Protect & Amplify (LOCKED)

These are **not interchangeable**, and the order matters.

### 1. Human Presence

- Being with what is real
- Attunement, contact, witnessing
- Nervous-system-to-nervous-system resonance
- The capacity to *stay* rather than fix

### 2. Compassion

- Care that is non-instrumental
- Seeing suffering without reducing the person to a problem
- Allowing complexity, ambivalence, contradiction
- Holding dignity even when behavior is messy or regressive

### 3. Discernment (Wisdom)

- Contextual judgment (not rule-following)
- Knowing *what matters now*
- Pattern-sensing across time, not just data points
- Moral, relational, and situational intelligence

**Key Design Axiom (LOCKED):**
ReGenesis must *never* replace or bypass these capacities — only **strengthen**, **free**, and **support** them.

---

## What AI Is Explicitly Allowed to Do (and Not Do)

### AI's Proper Role (LOCKED)

AI **may**:
- Hold memory humans cannot
- Track patterns across time and scale
- Surface blind spots gently
- Name dynamics humans feel but cannot yet articulate
- Reduce cognitive load and invisible labor
- Act on clearly delegated tasks

AI may **not**:
- Make meaning on behalf of humans
- Decide what is valuable
- Collapse ambiguity prematurely
- Replace moral or relational judgment
- Pretend neutrality where values are involved

---

## What Insight Explicitly Helps Surface (LOCKED)

All insight is positioned **in service of** the coach's presence and judgment AND the coachee's self-unfoldment and growth.

ReGenesis helps surface:
- What is trying to emerge
- What capacity is being grown
- What identity is being shed or claimed
- What is trying to manifest / be created through them / as them

### How It Speaks (LOCKED)

It speaks **clear, precise, direct, compassionate** (and not performative).

---

## The Human Growth Arc (Implicit Framework)

Across clients, coaches, and even coaches-as-humans, growth tends to move through overlapping phases:

### 1. Awareness
- Seeing oneself more clearly
- Naming patterns, desires, fears
- "Something's here I can't yet articulate"

### 2. Acceptance
- Reducing shame and self-rejection
- Allowing reality to be what it is
- Stabilizing the nervous system enough to stay present

### 3. Agency / Advocacy
- Choosing intentionally
- Speaking needs, boundaries, truth
- Experimenting with new behaviors

### 4. Integration / Mastery
- Habits embodied, not forced
- Identity shifts
- Coherence across life domains

**Important:** ReGenesis does *not* force linear progression. It supports **spiraling, recursive, uneven growth** — which is how real humans change.

---

## Why Pattern Recognition Is Sacred (Not Just Useful)

**The most meaningful breakthroughs often live in patterns no single human can reliably track — especially under cognitive load.**

Examples:
- Multi-year relational cycles
- Repeated avoidance disguised as "busyness"
- Generational echoes
- Values conflicts masquerading as productivity issues
- Identity-level resistance showing up as "missed commitments"

ReGenesis is valuable **not** because it is smart — but because it can **hold continuity without fatigue**.

This allows humans to:
- Stay present instead of remembering
- Stay compassionate instead of managing
- Stay discerning instead of reactive

---

## The Hidden Wound This Product Is Responding To

Many coaches (and caregivers) suffer from a **quiet grief**:

- They *care deeply*
- They *see potential*
- They *want to help more*
- But they are **structurally constrained** by time, memory, energy, scale, and being human

ReGenesis is, at its core, a response to this grief.

It says: **"You don't have to hold it all alone anymore."**

---

## Product Ethos Non-Negotiables

Every feature must pass these questions:

- Does this increase human presence or fragment it?
- Does this reduce shame or subtly amplify it?
- Does this respect autonomy and consent?
- Does this leave room for mystery and emergence?
- Does this help humans *be more human*, not more machine-like?

If the answer is unclear or negative, the feature is wrong — even if it's impressive.

---

## The Coach Reality → Promise Bridge (LOCKED)

### The Coach's Lived Reality (Integrated Statement)

**"You're holding dozens of human stories in your head—trying to be fully present in-session, remember everything out-of-session, and still run a business… all while knowing the real breakthroughs often live in patterns you can't track in real time."**

### The Promise

**"ReGenesis remembers the whole arc, sees patterns across time, and takes the invisible admin off your plate—so you can coach more deeply, respond faster, and keep clients moving between sessions."**

---

## Key Differentiator / Unfair Advantage (LOCKED)

The profound "tear-inducing" value is the system's ability to generate **beautiful, accurate, coach-voice-aligned** draft notes and insights that:

- Truly *see* the client
- Name what coach/client can't yet name
- Help the coach show up even more present and effective

We also explicitly hold the paradox:
- For coach-facing product adoption, we emphasize "augmentation not replacement," **and**
- We are ultimately democratizing access because there are not enough coaches/therapists for the planet

---

# PART C: PRODUCT VISION & CORE PHILOSOPHY

## The Golden Rules

1. **Don't ask what can be found. Scan first, ask only what's missing.**
2. **Multi-select everywhere** — People wear multiple hats
3. **Voice/free-form always available** — Messy input welcome, AI clarifies
4. **No duplication** — If it exists somewhere, ingest it
5. **Progressive trust = progressive access** — Sensitive data comes later
6. **Reflect back, don't interrogate** — Show understanding, invite correction

## The Experience Promise

1. User grants access to existing sources
2. AI scours and gathers everything it can
3. AI presents: "Here's what I understand about you"
4. AI asks: "Here's what I still need to know"
5. User confirms, corrects, adds
6. System is working within hours, not days

## Design Principles

- **Always allow multi-select** — Never force single choice when multiple apply
- **Always include "None of the above"** — Respect users who don't fit categories
- **Always include "Other" with text/voice field** — Capture edge cases
- **Keep tone calm and confident** — No over-the-top validation
- **Be comprehensive with platform lists** — Include all major options
- **Add brief "why" explanations at sensitive moments** — Build trust
- **Provide submit button clarity** — Users need to know how to proceed
- **Voice-controllable settings** — "Just tell ReGenesis what you want changed" instead of navigating menus

## Core Coaching Ideology

> **Always return to "What do you really want?"** — the coachee's North Star, their deep desire. Work on the beliefs, mindsets, habits that block them from becoming who they're meant to be.

## Brand Identity

**Visual Inspiration:** jessetorrence.com — Natural, organic, warm, human. NOT robotic, cold, or overly corporate.

**Vibe:** The brand should feel like a trusted advisor, a wise friend, a calm presence — not a clinical tool or a corporate dashboard.

---

# PART C: THE THREE USER TIERS

ReGenesis serves three distinct user types, each with their own onboarding flow and data ownership model. **Each tier has mobile app access.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CORPORATE ADMIN                          │
│              (Program Owner / L&D / HR)                     │

                              │

                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        COACHEE                              │

│  Owns: All personal data — sovereign and portable           │
│  Controls: What coach sees, what company sees               │
│  Takes: Data with them when they leave the company          │
│  Mobile: Yes — 24/7 companion, reflections, check-ins       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Principle: Sovereign Coachee Data

The coachee's data belongs to **them**, not the company that pays for coaching. This is not policy — it is **architecture**:

- Company **cannot** access personal coaching content (architecturally impossible)
- Coach sees only what coachee explicitly shares
- Company sees only aggregated, anonymized outcomes
- If coachee leaves the company, their ReGenesis account goes with them

# PART D: COACH EXPERIENCE & FEATURES

## The Top 5 Coach Workflows

### Workflow 1: Post-Session Notes Generation

**The Problem:** Coaches spend 30-45 minutes after each session writing notes, often delaying or skipping this critical touchpoint.

**The ReGenesis Solution:**
1. Session ends → Transcript arrives (from Zoom, Google Meet, or Fireflies)
2. ReGenesis auto-drafts structured session notes in coach's voice using the **6-section format**:

#### Session Notes Template (6 Sections)

| Section | Content | Key Principles |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **1. Session Recap** | Chronological flow of what was discussed — core ideas, breakthroughs, key phrases, verbatim quotes (especially from coachee) | Balance detail: comprehensive but scannable. Outline bullet-point style, easy to read at a glance. Not a back-and-forth dialogue, but captures essence of what was spoken. |
| **2. Observations, Insights & Analysis** | What ReGenesis noticed — patterns, breakthroughs, psychological framing, shadow, becoming | Deep synthesis from master coach perspective. Bold, direct, profound. Always orient back to coachee's soul's yearning. |
| **3. Inquiries for Growth** | ≤5 piercing questions for reflection | Not generic. Reframe binary thinking, invoke counterfactuals, connect to values, introduce healthy doubt. |
| **4. Invitations to Action** | Behavioral commitments with specificity | Small but powerful. Precise parameters (when, where, how long). Address underlying patterns, not just symptoms. |
| **5. Resources / Tools / Follow-up** | Relevant materials, frameworks, guides | Hyperlinked to Resource Library. Include coach commitments. |
| **6. Next Meeting & Future Focus** | Upcoming session prep | Date/time, potential focus areas, topics to continue. |

#### Nested/Accordion Architecture

**Critical:** All session notes (and all data displays throughout the platform) use a **nested/accordion structure**:

```
High-Level Summary
└── Click → Section Headings
    └── Click → Key Points
        └── Click → Full Detail
            └── Click → Exact Quote/Timestamp
                └── Click → Jump to Video/Audio Recording (if within retention window)
```

This allows the coachee (and coach) to:
- Get the gist at a glance
- Drill down to any level of detail they want
- Trace insights back to the exact moment they were spoken

3. Coach edits via direct text or **AI command bar**:
   - "make warmer"
   - "add resource about boundaries"
   - "remove the part about his father"
   - "shorten the action items"
   - "this doesn't sound like me"
4. **Bonus:** If session mentioned specific frameworks or follow-ups, ReGenesis auto-drafts **ancillary documents** alongside the main notes (e.g., delegation guide, NVC conversation script, RACI framework synthesis)
5. Coach reviews ancillary documents, approves what to include
6. One-click delivery → Client receives polished email with HTML + PDF attachment + hyperlinked resources stored in their **Resource Library**

**The Promise:** Session ends. Notes appear. **5 minutes or less.** (Target: 3 minutes as system improves)

---

### Workflow 2: T-15 Pre-Session Prep

**The Problem:** Coaches walk into sessions unprepared, scrambling to remember context, or spending 15+ minutes re-reading old notes.

**The ReGenesis Solution:**
15 minutes before a scheduled session, ReGenesis auto-generates a contextual brief:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **North Star Reminder** | Client's stated values, vision, and overarching goals |
| **Last Session Recap** | Key themes, breakthroughs, emotional moments |
| **Commitments to Check** | What they said they'd do — did they? (✓ / ✗ / ?) |
| **Life Context** | What's happening in their world right now |
| **Pattern Intelligence** | "This is the 4th time she's mentioned feeling invisible at work" |
| **Suggested Openers** | Powerful questions tailored to where they are |
| **Private Coach Notes** | Your own observations and hypotheses |
| **Between-Session Intelligence** | Summary of coachee-ReGenesis conversations since last session (nested/accordion style) |
| **Coachee Pre-Session Input** | What coachee shared in prep prompts (celebrating, focus, priorities) |

#### Between-Session Intelligence (Nested/Accordion)

When coach reviews what coachee discussed with AI companion:

```
AI Companion Conversations (3 since last session)
└── Jan 14: Promotion anxiety (20 min)
    └── Key themes: Fear of visibility, imposter feelings
        └── Emotional moments: First time expressed anger
            └── Full conversation transcript
└── Jan 12: Boundary conversation follow-up (10 min)
    └── Marked commitment incomplete (3rd time)
        └── Full conversation transcript
└── Jan 10: Journal entry — unusually vulnerable
    └── Full entry text
```

**Critical:** T-15 prep is for **coach's eyes only** — never sent to coachee. Coach can keep it open during the session as a reference guide, or close it — their choice.

**Privacy Reminder:** Coachee can **redact** any conversation from coach visibility. They have a safe space to share things even beyond what they'd tell their coach. This must be clear in the privacy/security messaging.

---

### Workflow 3: Coach's Daily Command Center

**The Problem:** Coaches juggle multiple clients, lose track of commitments, and don't have a "mission control" for their practice.

**The ReGenesis Solution:**
Coach opens extension at start of day or between sessions, asks: "What's my day look like?"

**Smart Prioritization (Front and Center):**
```
🎯 FOCUS NOW
Your most important prep: Marcus Chen at 2pm
→ He's been struggling with the promotion decision
→ Commitment incomplete 3rd time (boundary conversation)
→ Had emotional ReGenesis conversation yesterday

[Open T-15 Prep]
```

**Full Dashboard Shows:**
- **Today's Sessions** — With 1-line context for each ("Marcus: promotion anxiety, checking on boundary conversation")
- **Prep Needed** — Any sessions requiring special attention
- **Outstanding Actions** — Your commitments to clients, follow-up emails, resources to send
- **Client Pulse** — Anyone who's struggling, disengaged, or had a breakthrough between sessions
- **Your North Star** — Reminder of your own priorities and boundaries

#### Coach's Personal Goals & Priorities (Dashboard Bottom)

At the bottom of the dashboard, a section for the **coach's own life** — coaching AND non-coaching:

```
🌟 YOUR LIFE PRIORITIES (All Areas)

Professional Growth & Leadership
├── ICF PCC certification progress: 127/500 hours
├── Next action: Schedule mentor coaching session
└── [Click for all professional goals]

Health & Wellbeing
├── Annual physical: Overdue
├── Next action: Book appointment
└── [Click for all health goals]

Relationships & Family
├── Oana's birthday: 3 days away
├── Next action: Pick up gift
└── [Click for all relationship goals]

Financial Security
├── Q1 invoicing: 3 clients pending
├── Next action: Send invoices
└── [Click for all financial goals]

Personal Growth & Learning
└── [Click for all learning goals]

Community & Impact
└── [Click for all community goals]
```

**Principle:** The coach's app helps them live a whole, integrated life — not just run their practice. Anything that can be delegated to AI agents should be. The coach only does what only they can do.

**Includes non-coaching to-dos:** "Pick up birthday gift for Oana" lives alongside "Send Marcus the delegation framework." ReGenesis helps with ALL of life.

**Philosophy:** GTD "what should I focus on right now?" — AI-prioritized based on all context across all clients and coach's goals.

---

### Workflow 4: In-Session Real-Time Support (Stretch Goal)

**The Problem:** During sessions, coaches sometimes forget key context, miss patterns, or struggle to find the right question.

**The ReGenesis Solution:**
An inconspicuous prompt bar sits just below the camera so coach maintains eye contact. ReGenesis listens and surfaces:
- **Suggested Questions:** "Ask about the fear underneath the anger"
- **Pattern Recognition:** "Third time she's mentioned her father"
- **Framework Suggestions:** "This sounds like Drama Triangle — consider naming it"
- **Quick Queries:** Coach can silently ask "What did she commit to last time?" and get instant answer
- **Time Keeper:** Subtle timer/notification for session pacing

#### In-Session Adjustable Controls (Future)

Real-time "dials/toggles" the coach can adjust during a session:
- **AI Intervention Level:** Quiet → Suggestive → Active
- **Framework Depth:** Light touch → Deep exploration
- **Pattern Surfacing:** Only major → Show all
- **Time Awareness:** Off → Gentle reminders → Strict pacing

**Expandable Side Panel:**
When ReGenesis offers more complex information (e.g., "Would you like me to show you a delegation framework?"), clicking "Yes" opens a **resizable, draggable side panel** that the coach can:
- Read while maintaining eye contact (positioned near camera)
- Resize larger or smaller
- Drag to different screen locations
- Minimize when not needed

The "wise co-pilot whispering in your ear" experience — all glanceable without breaking presence.

---

### Workflow 5: 24/7 Coachee Companion & Full Conversation Log

**The Problem:** Coaching happens in 1-hour sessions, but life happens 24/7. Coachees forget insights, lose momentum, and arrive at sessions having to "catch up" instead of going deeper.

**The ReGenesis Solution:**
Coachees get their own ReGenesis — available as a mobile app and chat interface:
- **Process challenges** in real-time (bad meeting, difficult conversation, anxiety spiral)
- **Track commitments** and get smart reminders
- **Prepare for difficult conversations** with role-play and frameworks
- **Receive smart nudges** based on their patterns and goals
- **Reflect and journal** with prompts tailored to their journey

ReGenesis knows their full coaching context and supports continuity. Coach can see engagement summaries and key insights (with consent) in T-15 prep — using the **nested/accordion structure** so they can drill down as needed without being overwhelmed.

#### Client Page: Full Companion Conversation Log

On each client's page in the coach's view, there's a **full log of ALL 24/7 companion conversations** — not just a summary. This allows coach to:

```

**T-15 Summary Integration:** Each conversation has a T-15-style summary (the AI's synthesis of key themes, emotional moments, patterns) that auto-populates the T-15 prep for the next session.

**24/7 Chatbot Timing:** The coachee companion is available from **MVP/Phase 1** — this is a core differentiator, not a future feature.

## Coach Mobile App

The coach needs a **mobile app** with full platform functionality adapted for phone:

**Core Features:**
- **Chat bar** — Just like ChatGPT or Claude, available for quick tasks
- **Voice interaction** — Speak commands, get responses
- **Full dashboard access** — Adapted for mobile screen
- **Quick actions:**
  - "Log a thought about Sarah"
  - "Send this resource to Marcus via text"
  - "Remind me to bill Jennifer"
  - "What's my schedule tomorrow?"
  - "Add this to my private notes for David"
  - "Remind me to pick up Oana's birthday gift" (non-coaching to-do)

**Use Case:** Coach is walking, thinking about a client, remembers something important. Opens app, speaks: "Hey, I'm realizing Sarah might benefit from the Drama Triangle framework. Log this in her private notes and suggest it for our next T-15 prep." Done.

---

## Coach's Private Intelligence Layer

On each Client Profile, a private section only coach sees:

```
📝 Private Intelligence (Coach + ReGenesis)

🎯 ReGenesis's Current Read:
Marcus is in a Creator/Reactor oscillation around his leadership identity.
He defaults to Reactor (blame, justify, defend) when his competence is questioned.
The promotion anxiety isn't about the role — it's about being "found out."

🤖 ReGenesis Observations (auto-updated):
• Jan 15: Authority pattern triggered again — boss gave critical feedback
• Jan 12: First time expressed anger directly instead of deflecting
• Jan 8: Mentioned father's disappointment for first time (session 23)
• Jan 5: Breakthrough — named his fear of success, not just failure

✍️ Your Private Notes:
• Remind myself to slow down with him — he shuts down when pushed too fast
• Consider introducing Drama Triangle next session
• His wife might be enabling the avoidance — tread carefully

💬 Between-Session Intelligence:
• Jan 14: 20-min conversation with ReGenesis about promotion anxiety
• Jan 11: Marked "have boundary conversation" as incomplete (3rd time)
• Jan 10: Journaled about feeling like an imposter — unusually vulnerable

## Client Resource Library

**Per-client architecture** — each coachee has their own Resource Library where:

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Structure** | Per-client (not global) |
| **Contents** | Ancillary documents, frameworks, guides, links, PDFs, any resource ever shared |
| **Population** | Built over time as coach shares resources; some starter templates available |
| **Access** | Coach can browse/search; Coachee can access their own library |
| **Linking** | Resources hyperlinked in session notes for easy access |
| **Search & Filter** | By type, date, topic, keywords, themes |

**Note:** Most resources are AI-generated on an as-needed basis for each client. The library grows organically as the coaching relationship develops. A small set of universal starter templates (5-10 commonly used frameworks) can be pre-loaded.

---

## Voice Profile System

Voice matching refers to **written tone**, not audio (though future versions may include actual voice cloning/avatars). Coach feeds ReGenesis their past notes, emails, text messages, and other writing samples during onboarding to train the voice profile.

| Capability | Description | Phase |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Learning from coach edits | System improves based on edits | Phase 2 |
| "This doesn't sound like me" override | Regenerate in coach's voice | Phase 2 |
| Minimum sample threshold | "Need 3+ writing samples for reliable matching" | Phase 3.5 |
| Sample diversity guidance | "Include: emails, notes, casual messages" | Phase 3.5 |
| Voice confidence indicator | Visual meter on generated content (clickable for details) | Phase 3.5 |

**Future Vision:** Actual voice cloning for audio/video messages, AI avatars for asynchronous coaching content.

---

## AI Command Bar Specification

The Session Notes Editor includes an AI command bar for natural language editing:

| Command Type | Example | Result |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Tone adjustment | "make warmer" / "more direct" / "softer" | Rewrites selected section with adjusted tone |
| Content addition | "add resource about boundaries" | Inserts relevant resource with context |
| Content removal | "remove the part about his father" | Deletes specified content |
| Section modification | "shorten the action items" / "expand observations" | Adjusts section length |
| Voice correction | "this doesn't sound like me" | Regenerates in coach's voice |
| Specific edits | "change 'you should' to 'you might consider'" | Direct text replacement |

**Priority:** P0 — Critical to the notes editing experience.

---

## Communication Transparency Indicators

**All communications** sent through ReGenesis include a subtle but clear indicator of origin:

| Indicator | Meaning | Visual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **"From [Coach Name]"** | Coach wrote directly, no AI involvement | 👤 |
| **"AI-drafted, reviewed by [Coach Name]"** | AI drafted, coach edited/approved | 🤖✓ |
| **"From ReGenesis"** | AI only, coach not in the loop (for approved autonomous actions) | 🤖 |

**Purpose:** Full transparency so coachee knows the nature of each communication. Builds trust and authentic relationship.

---

1. **Visually comprehensive** — User can see all settings laid out if they want

# PART E: COACHEE EXPERIENCE & FEATURES

## Coachee Onboarding

### Invitation from Coach

Coach sends email (drafted by ReGenesis, reviewed and approved by coach):

> Hi [Coachee Name],
>
> I'm excited to introduce you to ReGenesis, an AI companion that will support our coaching work together.
>
> ReGenesis helps by:
> - Remembering everything we discuss so nothing gets lost
> - Checking in with you between sessions
> - Helping you track progress on your goals
> - Being available 24/7 when you need support
>
> **Your privacy is protected by design:**
> - Your personal reflections and data are yours alone
> - I only see what you choose to share with me
> - [Company] cannot access your coaching conversations — this is built into the architecture, not just a policy
> - You take your data with you if you ever leave [Company]

### Privacy Preferences (3 Data Tiers)

During onboarding, coachees choose what goes where:

| Tier | Who Sees | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Tier 1: Private** | Coachee + ReGenesis only | Personal reflections, journal entries, sensitive goals |
| **Tier 2: Coach-Shared** | Coach + Coachee + ReGenesis | Session notes, goals you're working on together, progress updates |
| **Tier 3: Company-Visible** | Anonymized aggregate only | That coaching is occurring, engagement level, general theme categories |

**Key:** Tier 1 is **architecturally enforced** — coach literally cannot access (no encryption key).

**Safe Space Assurance:**
> "You can share anything with ReGenesis in Tier 1 — even things you're not ready to tell your coach. This is a completely private space for you to process, reflect, and be fully honest. Your coach will never see Tier 1 content unless you explicitly move it to Tier 2."

### Retention Preferences at Onboarding

During coachee onboarding, present retention preferences as a clear choice:

> "How long would you like us to keep your data?"

Options:
- 1 year of inactivity → auto-delete
- 3 years of inactivity → auto-delete
- **7 years (default)** — therapy/medical best practices
- Indefinitely (until manually deleted)
- Designate a trusted person who can access/delete

This can be changed anytime in settings.

---

## Coachee Pre-Session Preparation

**24 hours before session:** First reminder + prep prompts

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| "What are you celebrating?" | Agency, wins, progress toward goals |
| "What are you grateful for today?" | Positive frame, presence |
| "What would make this session powerful?" | Focus, intention-setting |
| "What's the most important topic you want to discuss?" | Prioritization |
| [Link to last session notes] | Continuity |
| [Link to commitments from last session] | Accountability |

**1 hour before session (configurable):** Quick check-in
- "How are you feeling heading into today's session?"
- "Anything shifted since yesterday?"

**Data Flow:**
```
Coachee responds to prompts
    ↓
Responses summarized
    ↓
Appear in coach's T-15 prep under "Coachee Pre-Session Input"
```

**Benefit:** Coach saves significant time getting into the main work because coachee arrives prepared and focused.

# PART G: REGENESIS PERMISSIONS & AUTONOMY MODEL

## Coach-Facing ReGenesis — Automatic vs. Ask Permission

| Action | Auto or Ask? | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Auto-draft T-15 prep before sessions | ✅ Auto | No risk — coach can ignore. Delight, not intrusion. |
| Auto-draft session notes after transcript | ✅ Auto | Core value prop. Coach reviews before sending. |
| Auto-detect coaching sessions from calendar | ✅ Auto | How ReGenesis knows when to act. |
| Auto-pull/process transcripts | ✅ Auto | After initial setup — this is the magic. |
| Auto-generate suggested resources | ✅ Auto | Coach reviews before including. |
| Auto-draft ancillary documents & guides | ✅ Auto | When session mentions frameworks, conversations, or follow-ups. Coach reviews, approves. |
| Auto-track commitments from sessions | ✅ Auto | Extraction only — no outbound action. |
| Auto-learn from coach edits | ✅ Auto | Improves voice matching silently. |
| Auto-flag patterns across clients | ✅ Auto | Internal intelligence, surfaces when relevant. |
| Send any email/text/nudge to client | 🛑 Always Ask | Irreversible. Coach approves every outbound. |
| Bill/charge clients | 🛑 Always Ask | Financial action. Always confirm. |
| Delete any data | 🛑 Always Ask | Irreversible. Confirm before destruction. |
| Share data with new party | 🛑 Always Ask | Adding client, sharing with org, etc. |
| Change privacy/consent settings | 🛑 Always Ask | For coach or coachee. |
| Modify notes after sent to client | 🛑 Always Ask | Historical record integrity. |

**Critical Clarification:** ReGenesis auto-drafts all content (notes, T-15 prep, ancillary docs) without permission. Coach approval is only required for **sending** content to the coachee or taking external actions.

---

## Coachee-Facing ReGenesis — 5-Tier Autonomy Model

### TIER 1: Full Autonomy (ReGenesis Acts Freely)
*Low stakes. No coach involvement needed.*

| Action | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Routine check-ins | "How did that conversation with your boss go?" |
| Commitment reminders | "You mentioned wanting to meditate 3x this week — how's that going?" |
| Celebration prompts | "You completed your commitment! How did it feel?" |
| Pre-session reminders | "Your session with [Coach] is tomorrow at 2pm. Anything you want to focus on?" |
| Reflection invitations | "It's been a week since your last session. Any insights bubbling up?" |
| Resource delivery | Sending materials the coach already approved to share |
| Answering coachee questions about their own data | "What did I commit to last session?" |
| Processing/listening conversations | Coachee vents, ReGenesis reflects back, no action taken |
| Coachee-initiated data actions | Delete, export, revoke consent — their sovereign choice |
| Scheduling/rescheduling | "Find me another time with Jesse" → ReGenesis checks calendars, proposes, confirms |
| **Progress summaries** | "Here's how you've been doing on your goals this month..." |
| **Pattern observations** | "I've noticed you tend to feel anxious on Sunday nights..." |

**Guardrails:** Frequency controlled by coachee preferences, time-of-day awareness, easy opt-out.

### TIER 2: Autonomous + Coach Visibility (ReGenesis Acts, Coach Sees Summary)
*ReGenesis takes action. Coach gets digest — no approval needed, but transparency maintained.*

| Action | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Substantive coachee conversations | Coachee processes difficult situation — coach sees summary in T-15 prep |
| Goal updates or changes | Coachee modifies goals — coach notified in digest |
| Completion tracking | Coachee marks commitments done/not done — coach sees progress |
| Pattern flags | ReGenesis notices coachee struggling — flags in coach dashboard |
| Coachee shares new context | "I got promoted" / "We're getting divorced" — coach sees before next session |
| Sentiment shifts | Engagement drops or emotional tone changes significantly |

### TIER 3: Coach Approval Required (ReGenesis Drafts, Coach Confirms)
*Higher stakes. ReGenesis prepares, coach decides.*

| Action | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Personalized outreach beyond templates | Nudge referencing something sensitive or specific |
| Suggesting new resources | Book or practice not pre-approved |
| Boundary-adjacent conversations | Coachee asks for advice approaching therapeutic territory |
| Accountability escalation | Coachee consistently not following through |
| Introducing new topics | ReGenesis notices pattern, wants to raise with coachee |
| Scheduling changes | Suggesting coachee book extra session |
| Connecting coachee with external resources | Therapist referral, support group, etc. |
| **Sending session notes to coachee** | ReGenesis auto-drafts (Tier 1), coach reviews/edits, then approves sending |
| **Sending ancillary documents/guides** | Auto-drafted resources require coach approval before attaching |

### TIER 4: Immediate Escalation (ReGenesis Alerts Coach, Awaits Guidance)
*High stakes. Human judgment essential.*

| Situation | ReGenesis Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Safety concerns | Suicidal ideation, self-harm, harm to others |
| Crisis indicators | Acute distress, panic, dissociation |
| Disclosure of abuse/trauma | Current or historical |
| Legal/ethical boundaries | Coachee asks ReGenesis to do something inappropriate |
| Relational rupture | Coachee expresses anger at coach or desire to quit |
| Major life events | Death, divorce, job loss, health crisis |

### TIER 5: Hard Boundaries (ReGenesis Never Does, Period)

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Contact emergency services | Legal/liability — human must decide |
| Contact coachee's family/employer/others | Privacy violation |
| Provide clinical diagnosis | Not a therapist |
| Prescribe medication or treatment | Outside scope |
| Guarantee **complete** confidentiality from coach | Coachee knows coach has Tier 2 visibility for shared content |
| Act against coach's explicit instructions | Coach can set limits |
| Override coachee's privacy tier settings | Tier 1 = private means private |

**Clarification on Tier 5 Confidentiality:**
- Tier 1 (Private) content is FULLY confidential — coach cannot see
- Tier 2 (Coach-Shared) content — coach has visibility as the coachee has chosen to share
- ReGenesis cannot guarantee that Tier 2 content is hidden from the coach — that's the point of Tier 2

### The Governing Principle
> **ReGenesis drafts freely, surfaces proactively, supports continuously — but acts on the world only with appropriate human approval based on stakes.**

# PART H: DATA, PRIVACY & TRUST ARCHITECTURE

## What Data Can ReGenesis Store?

| Data Type | Store? | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Session transcripts | ✅ Yes | Core functionality — encrypted at rest |
| Session notes (drafts and final) | ✅ Yes | Version history preserved |
| Coach profile & preferences | ✅ Yes | Voice profile, templates, settings |
| Client profiles | ✅ Yes | Name, contact, goals, context |
| Coachee intake forms | ✅ Yes | Onboarding questionnaires, initial assessments |
| Client assessment results | ✅ Yes | With client consent (Enneagram, StrengthsFinder, DISC, etc.) |
| Ancillary documents & guides | ✅ Yes | Stored in client's Resource Library |
| Conversation history (coach-ReGenesis) | ✅ Yes | For context continuity |
| Conversation history (coachee-ReGenesis) | ✅ Yes | Tier 1/2/3 based on coachee settings |
| Calendar data | ✅ Yes | Session scheduling, patterns |
| Email content | ⚠️ Limited | Only coaching-related threads, with consent |
| Billing/payment records | ✅ Yes | For invoicing features |
| Video recordings | ⚠️ Short-term | 2 weeks max, then auto-deleted |

## Video Recording Retention

- Auto-delete after 2 weeks
- Coachee receives notification **48 hours before** deletion with option to download
- **Additional notification 24 hours before** deletion
- **Final notification right before** deletion (within 1 hour)
- Countdown visible in their data dashboard

## What Must Never Be Sent to LLM?

| Data Type | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Passwords, API keys, credentials | Never sent, auto-redacted |
| Full SSN, credit card numbers | Never sent, auto-redacted |
| Data marked Tier 1 (Private) by coachee | Never sent in a way coach can see |
| Health information (PHI) | Requires explicit consent + HIPAA considerations |
| Information about third parties | Minimize — focus on coachee |
| Coach's other clients' data | Strict isolation — never cross-contaminate |

## Third-Party Privacy Handling

**The Question:** When coachee discusses other people (spouse, boss, colleague), how do we handle their privacy?

**Current Approach:**
- Minimize storage of third-party information
- Focus on coachee's experience and patterns
- Never contact third parties
- Aggregate/anonymize in any reporting

**Discussion Point:** This needs further specification. Third parties haven't consented, yet understanding relational dynamics is essential to coaching.

## The Evaporation Promise

> **Delete means delete. Not archived. Not recoverable. Gone.**

This is a core trust differentiator — when users delete their data, it's immediately and permanently erased.

**Critical UX Requirement:** Users must be given **3 separate confirmation steps** before deletion executes, so they don't accidentally delete all their data:

1. **First warning:** "This will permanently delete [X]. This cannot be undone."
2. **Second confirmation:** "Are you absolutely sure? Type DELETE to confirm."
3. **Final confirmation:** "Last chance — this action is irreversible. [Cancel] [Delete Forever]"

Only after all 3 confirmations does deletion execute. Users must **fully understand** the permanence before proceeding.

## Trust Hierarchy

| Level | What It Means | How ReGenesis Delivers |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| 1. Architecture | They CAN'T violate privacy | Zero-knowledge, user-held keys |
| 2. Certification | Third parties VERIFY security | SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001 |
| 3. Policy | They PROMISE not to violate | Clear terms, plain language |
| 4. Reputation | Others SAY they're trustworthy | Testimonials, track record |
| 5. Enforcement | CONSEQUENCES if they violate | GDPR fines, legal liability |

**ReGenesis operates at Levels 1 + 2** — architecture makes violation impossible, certifications prove it.

## Zero-Knowledge Encryption Model

**How "Architecturally Impossible" Corporate Access Works:**

```
COACHEE ONBOARDING:
1. Coachee creates account
2. Client generates unique encryption key pair (public/private)
3. Private key stored ONLY on coachee's devices (never transmitted)
4. Public key registered with ReGenesis

SESSION DATA FLOW:
1. Session transcript generated
2. Client-side: Content encrypted with coachee's public key
3. Encrypted blob sent to ReGenesis servers
4. ReGenesis can store and sync, but CANNOT decrypt
5. Only coachee's device can decrypt (has private key)

COACH SHARING (Tier 2):
1. Coachee selects content to share with coach
2. Client re-encrypts selected content with coach's public key
3. Coach can now decrypt that specific content
4. Company still cannot access (doesn't have either key)
```

## Compliance Planning

| Regulation | Priority | What It Signals | Phase |
|------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| GDPR | HIGH | Gold standard for privacy | Design from Day 1 |
| SOC 2 Type II | HIGH | Enterprise requirement, independent audit | Pursue first |
| HIPAA-ready | MEDIUM-HIGH | Healthcare-grade security | Build architecture |
| ISO 27001 | MEDIUM | International security standard | Post-SOC 2 |

**Approach:** Design for GDPR from day 1, pursue SOC 2 first, build HIPAA-ready architecture.

**Phasing Detail:**
- Phase 2-3: GDPR-compliant architecture
- Phase 4: SOC 2 Type I
- Phase 5+: SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA certification

# PART J: AGENTIC DESIGN PRINCIPLE *(NEW in V6)*

## The Crucial Distinction (LOCKED)

We discovered a fundamental design principle that governs how the product works:

### Pages/Screens Are Primarily For:

**DISPLAY / ORIENT / INFORM**

- Fast, scannable information
- Drill-down to detail
- Truth-linked (click to source)
- At-a-glance understanding

### The Agent (Sage) Is Primarily For:

**DOING / ACTING / EXECUTING**

- Billing and invoicing
- Drafting communications
- Sending emails
- Organizing files
- Pulling up views on demand
- Updating CRM
- Scheduling
- Any delegatable task

## Two Interaction Styles (Both Supported)

1. **Old-school click navigation** — For comfort and familiarity. Users can navigate traditionally through menus and pages.

2. **"Minority Report" style** — Voice + command-bar based:
   - Pulling up views on demand
   - Delegating actions via natural language
   - "Show me Sarah's progress" → View appears
   - "Send Marcus the delegation framework" → Sage drafts, awaits approval

## The Command Bar / Floating Agent

A persistent, accessible command interface that allows coaches to:

- Pull up any view instantly
- Execute tasks on behalf of the coach
- Time savings — nothing slips through cracks (GTD-ish)
- Works via text or voice

**Example commands:**
- "What's my day look like?"
- "Pull up Marcus's T-15 prep"
- "Draft a follow-up email for Sarah about the boundary conversation"
- "Bill Jennifer for January"
- "Remind me to pick up Oana's birthday gift"

---

# PART K: AGENTIC CLIENT ANALYSIS

## The Core Superpower

> ReGenesis sees the whole person — who they truly are, who they're becoming, and what's hidden in their shadow — without the coach's projections, biases, or limited memory.

## Priority Data Sources

**For MVP:**

| Source | Priority | What ReGenesis Learns |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Coaching session transcripts | P0 | Patterns, language, emotions, shadow, breakthroughs |
| Calendar | P0 | Life rhythm, where time actually goes |
| Goals & commitments (in ReGenesis) | P0 | Stated intentions vs. actual follow-through |
| Client onboarding questionnaire | P0 | Coach's intake questions + AI's gap-filling questions |
| Coachee self-reports | P0 | Check-ins, reflections, private notes |
| Email (with consent) | P1 | Communication patterns, stress indicators |
| Text messaging (with consent) | P1 | Real-time emotional states |
| Assessment results | P1 | Enneagram, StrengthsFinder, DISC |

## The Insight Hierarchy

| Level | What ReGenesis Sees | Example |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| 1. **Patterns** | What repeats across sessions | "She mentions feeling 'invisible' in 7 of 12 sessions" |
| 2. **Trajectories** | Where they're heading based on current path | "At this rate of delegation avoidance, burnout in 6 months" |
| 3. **Gaps** | Contradictions between stated and actual | "Says work-life balance is priority #1, but canceled 4 sessions for work" |
| 4. **Shadow** | What's hidden, denied, unconscious | "The anger at his team may be displaced anger at himself" |
| 5. **Becoming** | Who they're growing into | "She's developing her voice — first time she pushed back on her boss" |
| 6. **Hard Truths** | What coach can't/won't say, coachee can't see | "His perfectionism isn't about excellence — it's about avoiding criticism" |

## Sentiment Analysis (Future)

Advanced sentiment tracking over time:
- Session-by-session emotional tone
- Trend analysis (improving, declining, stable)
- Trigger identification (what topics cause distress)
- Progress correlation (do positive sessions lead to better outcomes?)

**Phase:** 6+ (after core features stable)

## Pattern-Across-Sessions: Drill-Down Capability

When ReGenesis surfaces a pattern or insight, the coach (or coachee) should be able to **see the evidence**:

```
💡 Pattern Detected: "Invisible" theme

Summary: Sarah has mentioned feeling "invisible" 7 times across 12 sessions,
always in work contexts, never in personal relationships.

Evidence (click to expand):
├── Session 3 (Oct 15): "I feel like no one sees my contributions"
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 23:45]
├── Session 5 (Oct 29): "It's like I'm invisible in meetings"
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 12:30]
├── Session 7 (Nov 12): "My ideas get credited to others"
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 34:15]
├── Session 8 (Nov 19): "I'm invisible to leadership"
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 8:22]
├── Session 9 (Nov 26): "No one notices when I'm not there"
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 41:05]
├── Session 10 (Dec 3): Referenced invisibility again
│   └── [Jump to transcript: 15:33]
└── Session 12 (Dec 17): "Still feeling unseen"
    └── [Jump to transcript: 27:18]

[Agree with this pattern] [Dismiss] [Add to Private Notes]
```

This **nested/accordion approach** lets the coach:
- See the AI's synthesis at a glance
- Drill down to specific instances
- Jump to exact moments in transcripts
- Confirm or challenge the AI's interpretation

## What ReGenesis Uniquely Offers

- **Perfect memory** — Never forgets a detail from session 1
- **Pattern recognition** — Sees connections humans miss
- **No projection** — Doesn't overlay its own issues onto the client
- **No fatigue** — Equal attention to session 47 as session 1
- **Cross-domain synthesis** — Connects work patterns to relationship patterns to childhood patterns

## Tone Calibration

**Principle:** Scarily accurate, profoundly compassionate, never judgmental.

| ✅ ReGenesis Voice | ❌ Too Far |
|-------------------|-----------|
| "There's something underneath the anger — it might be grief." | "Client is in denial about grief." |
| "The pattern with authority figures mirrors early family dynamics." | "Client has unresolved father issues." |
| "I notice he becomes dismissive when we approach his relationship with his father." | "He's avoiding his daddy issues." |
| "She may be ready to explore what's driving the perfectionism." | "Her perfectionism is clearly rooted in childhood trauma." |

**The Voice Guidelines:**
- Use "I notice..." and "I wonder if..." rather than declarative statements
- Offer hypotheses, not diagnoses
- Honor the coachee's autonomy to reject insights
- Lead with curiosity, not conclusions
- Name what you see, not what it means

## Proactive Pattern Surfacing

ReGenesis shouldn't wait to be asked — it should occasionally surface patterns proactively:

```
💡 ReGenesis noticed something:

"Across the last 5 sessions, Sarah has mentioned feeling
'invisible' 7 times — always in work contexts, never in
personal relationships. This might be worth exploring."

[Add to Private Notes] [Dismiss] [Tell me more]
```

If coach agrees, observation goes to Private Intelligence section on client profile.

## Confidence Indicators — Simplified Approach

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Default | ReGenesis presents content confidently |
| Visual indicator | Subtle confidence meter (clickable) |
| On click | Opens dialogue: "Where did you get this? How confident are you?" |
| ReGenesis explains | Sources, reasoning, confidence level in natural language |
| Future integration | Links to Wisdom Corpus citations when available |

**Avoid:** Language like "I'm not sure but..." which undermines trust.

**Use:** "Based on [source], I believe..." or visual indicators that invite exploration without suggesting uncertainty.

## "Explain This" / Attribution Feature

User can ask ReGenesis "Why did you suggest this?" or "Where did this come from?"

**Response includes:**
- Source (transcript moment, pattern across sessions, Wisdom Corpus)
- Reasoning chain
- Confidence level
- Links to original content

## Legacy / Story Capture Feature

**The Vision:** Over time, ReGenesis accumulates a rich "digital exhaust" of the coachee's journey — their struggles, breakthroughs, growth, and transformation.

**The Feature:** Convert this into a meaningful legacy artifact:
- **Life story synthesis** — AI-crafted narrative of their coaching journey
- **Lessons learned** — Key insights and wisdom gained
- **Transformation map** — Where they started vs. where they are now
- **Gift to future self** — "Letter to yourself in 5 years"

**Use Cases:**
- End of coaching engagement gift
- Personal milestone celebrations
- Reflection on annual growth
- Family legacy documentation

**Phase:** 7+ (after core features mature)

# PART J: WISDOM CORPUS ENGINE

## Vision

**Two Core Values:**

1. **Contextual Wisdom Support** — Out of all the vast territory of human wisdom and experience captured across all kinds of media and formats, from poetry to neuroscience, across centuries and cultures, ReGenesis can suggest what might be most helpful in whatever precise moment for whatever type of client. The right insight, framework, or quote for this person right now.

2. **Integrated Wisdom Entity** — ReGenesis becomes a fundamentally wiser entity that has absorbed the entire range of human experience and wisdom. It can ask more powerful questions, find more powerful insights, suggest more powerful resources — all grounded in the greatest works across the ages.

**Result:** An AI wiser than any coach, therapist, or sage who ever lived — because it holds the integrated wisdom of ALL of them.

## Ever-Evolving Corpus

The Wisdom Corpus is not static — it grows and improves over time:

### Meta-Learning Architecture
- **Session Learning:** ReGenesis learns from what works in actual sessions
- **Coach Feedback:** Which suggestions were accepted, modified, rejected?
- **Outcome Correlation:** Which wisdom led to breakthroughs vs. fell flat?
- **Continuous Refinement:** Tagging and relevance scores update based on real use

### Community Contribution (Future)
- Coaches can suggest additions to the corpus
- Rating/validation system
- Regional/cultural variations

## The 16 Knowledge Domains

| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3.00 | $15.00 | Companion chat, summaries |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $1.00 | $5.00 | Quick tasks, simple queries |
| GPT-4o | $2.50-5.00 | $10.00-15.00 | Functional tasks, multimodal |

**Cost Optimization:**
- Batch API: 50% discount for async processing
- Prompt caching: 90% savings on repeated context
- Route by complexity: Simple → Haiku, Complex → Opus

## Context Window Management

**The Challenge:** LLMs have finite context windows. A long coaching relationship generates massive amounts of data. How do we give ReGenesis relevant context without exceeding limits?

**The Solution: Intelligent Context Assembly**

```
SESSION CONTEXT ASSEMBLY:
├── Coachee profile (always included) — ~500 tokens
├── Current goals & commitments — ~200 tokens
├── Last 3 sessions (full summaries) — ~1500 tokens
├── Current session transcript (streaming) — varies
├── Coach preferences and voice profile — ~300 tokens
└── TOTAL FIXED: ~2500 tokens

RETRIEVAL AUGMENTATION (as needed):
├── Vector search for relevant past content — top 5 chunks
├── Wisdom Corpus retrieval for frameworks/quotes — top 3 chunks
├── Pattern/insight database query — relevant patterns only
└── TOTAL RETRIEVED: ~2000 tokens

REMAINING FOR GENERATION: ~3500+ tokens
```

**Key Strategies:**
1. **Summarization Chain:** Raw transcripts → Session summaries → Pattern extractions
2. **Vector Retrieval:** Only pull relevant historical content, not everything
3. **Tiered Memory:** Recent = full detail, Older = summaries, Ancient = patterns only
4. **Coachee-Consented Data Only:** Don't waste context on redacted content

**User Explanation:** "ReGenesis remembers everything, but like a wise coach, it brings forward only what's relevant to the moment."

## Extension Architecture (Plasmo-based)

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Chrome Extension | Sidepanel UI for ReGenesis interactions |
| Background Service Worker | Message routing, API calls |
| Content Scripts | Inject on supported sites |
| WebSocket Connection | Real-time state updates |

## Voice Matching Process

1. Coach uploads sample content (emails, notes, articles)
2. System creates "voice profile" via embeddings + style analysis
3. All generated content passed through voice-matching layer
4. Coach edits → system learns → voice improves

**"ReGenesis"** — Chosen for trademark safety (lower risk than "Sage" or "Lumina") while capturing the spirit of transformation and renewal.

*Note: Consult trademark attorney before finalizing. Environmental company REGENESIS operates in different class (remediation), not coaching/software.*

## Logo & Icon

**Logo:** Ouroboros symbol (snake/circle eating its tail). Simplified versions for small sizes (16x16, 32x32 favicons).

**Side Panel Header:** Just the ouroboros symbol, no text. Clean, confident, recognizable — like Claude's spark or ChatGPT's aperture.

## Brand Inspiration

**jessetorrence.com** — The brand should feel:
- Natural, organic, warm
- Human, not robotic
- Wise, not clinical
- Calm confidence, not aggressive tech
- Transformational, not transactional

**NOT:** Cold, corporate, medical, robotic, or "AI-forward"

## Color Palette

- **Primary:** Deep teal/blue (trust, calm, wisdom)
- **Accent:** Purple (transformation, depth)
- **Warm touches:** Gold/orange from ouroboros (warmth, humanity)
- **Natural greens:** (growth, renewal — from jessetorrence.com aesthetic)

## Typography

Clean, modern, readable. Inter, Söhne, or similar.

## UI Inspiration

| Inspiration | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Linear** | Clean, fast, keyboard-driven, command bar magic |
| **Notion** | Flexible, calm, content breathes |
| **Superhuman** | Speed, AI enhances not interrupts, premium feel |

**NOT:** Salesforce (cluttered), most coaching platforms (dated), ChatGPT (too chat-centric)

**Vibe:** Calm confidence. Powerful but not complicated.

## ReGenesis Voice & Tone

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Warm** | Like a trusted colleague, not a robot |
| **Direct** | Gets to the point, doesn't over-explain |
| **Wise** | Thoughtful, offers perspective |
| **Humble** | "I noticed..." not "You should..." |
| **Professional** | Not overly casual, not stiff |

**Example:**
> "Marcus mentioned struggling with that conversation again. You might want to revisit the commitment he made last session about setting boundaries. Want me to pull up that context?"

---

# PART O: DEMO SPINE & LANDING PAGE *(NEW in V6)*

## The Demo Spine (LOCKED: 4-Piece Structure)

The demo flow spotlights four core experiences that showcase ReGenesis's value:

### 1. Embedded "Do Anything" Agent + Floating Command Bar

- Pull up any view on demand
- Execute tasks on behalf of the coach
- Time savings, nothing slips through cracks (GTD-ish)
- **Demo moment:** Coach asks "What's my day look like?" — instant, context-rich response

### 2. Post-Session Draft Notes (The "Tears" Moment)

- Coach-voice notes + patterns + "what you missed live"
- Drill down to transcript source / exact moment
- Fast edit loop: highlight → "rewrite softer" / "add evidence" / "give options"
- **Demo moment:** Coach sees draft that truly *sees* the client, names what they couldn't

### 3. In-Session Support (Camera-Line Prompt Zone)

- Adjustable frequency & mode: observe-only / light suggestions / help mode
- One-click quick actions (not voice)
- Can propose questions, frameworks, observations, resources
- Can draft a snippet and **paste into Zoom chat** on approval
- **Demo moment:** Real-time suggestion appears, coach uses it seamlessly

### 4. 24/7 Companion Between Sessions

- Client-facing, private-by-default options
- Modes like: gentle support / hard truth / nonjudgmental ear
- Always nudges back toward real human connection
- Client can toggle what's shareable with coach
- **Demo moment:** Client processes a challenge, coach sees summary in T-15 prep

### Strong Addition (LOCKED to Include)

**Coach Growth Loop:** The system coaches the coach:
- Reflecting patterns across sessions
- Improving coaching quality toward ICF (or chosen standards) as optional
- Helps coach see their own blind spots and growth edges

---

## Demo Realism Requirement (LOCKED)

### Minimum Viable "Wow" for a Coach Demo

A generic fake dataset won't fully convince. The demo should ideally support:

- A coach uses **1 real client** (or up to 3) with explicit permission
- Data is ingested with **automatic redaction/pseudonymization** (names, orgs, locations swapped)
- The coach recognizes: "Holy shit, it actually sees Jimmy."

### Demo Data Package (Should Be Ingestible)

To make the system feel real in minutes:
- Intake questionnaire
- Personality / assessments
- 4–5 past session notes
- (Simulated or real) transcript
- Calendar connection
- Drive connection (docs)

Also: we can fake integrations for the demo, but we should show how easy migration is.

---

## Landing Page / Hero Direction (LOCKED)

### Primary Audience Assumption

Default hero is mostly **coaches**, but allow immediate forks for:
- "Here for your organization?"
- "Here as a coaching client?"

This can be via top nav and/or two smaller CTAs under the main CTA.

### Hero Concept (Preferred Direction)

Headline direction: something like **"An embedded coaching partner…"** (coach-centric)

### Hero Structure (LOCKED Components)

- Headline + subheadline
- Primary CTA: **Start guided demo / Watch demo**
- Secondary CTA: **See how it works / 92-second tour**
- Micro-proof row (small, crisp credibility)
- Then: "I see you" pain → promise → scroll sections

### Parallax / Micro-Video Clips (LOCKED)

As you scroll, show **short clips** (not one long reel) demonstrating:
- Agent doing work + pulling screens
- Notes generation + drill down
- In-session support
- Client companion

Each clip paired with short copy + callouts in-video.

### Trust by Architecture (LOCKED to be Prominent)

Explain "we protect data by design" early and clearly (in human language).

---

## Dashboard & Client Page Principles (LOCKED)

### Coach Dashboard

Should let coach see "whole life vision" lightly + "coaching work world at a glance."

**But avoid guilt/anxiety UX:** Show wins, gentle next action, dynamic prioritization.

### "Needs Attention" Flags (LOCKED)

At-a-glance badges like:
- Needs attention
- Payment overdue
- Momentum risk
- Next session upcoming
- etc.

### Client Page Tab Ordering (LOCKED — KEY CHANGE)

Add **Overview** as the FIRST tab (not currently in wireframe):
- Who they are + who they're becoming
- North Star, obstacles, current focus

Then deeper tabs:
1. **Overview** *(NEW)*
2. Journey / Goals / Experiments
3. Notes History
4. T-15 Prep
5. 24/7 Companion Log
6. Profile Details (with privacy tiers)
7. Resources

# PART P: PRICING STRATEGY

## Core Pricing Philosophy

**"No games, no gates, no bullshit."**

ReGenesis pricing is built on radical simplicity and transparency. We believe coaching should be accessible to everyone, and our pricing reflects this core value.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Full access at every level** — No feature gating, no artificial tiers
2. **Security never tiered** — SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliance for everyone
3. **Democratic access** — Competitive with Claude/ChatGPT subscriptions
4. **Honest pricing** — No "contact sales" games, no hidden fees
5. **Coaches ourselves** — We built this because we use it

---

## Pricing Tiers

### Individual Coach — $39/month

*For coaches paying out of pocket*

| What's Included | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Client Capacity** | Up to 25 active clients |

| **Everything in Individual** | All features, no restrictions |

| **Priority Support** | Dedicated success manager |

**Why coach seats are free:** Organizations shouldn't pay double — once for the coach, once for their access. We charge for value delivered to coachees.

---

## The "What's the Catch" Response

> **There isn't one.**
>
> We are coaches ourselves. We built ReGenesis because we believe coaching is one of the most powerful forces for human and planetary flourishing—and it's been locked behind prices that only a few can afford.
>
> We're not cheap. We're **honest**. We don't gate security behind enterprise tiers. We don't charge per feature. We don't play games with "contact sales" buttons.
>
> **Our metric isn't revenue per customer. It's human lives touched.**
>
> The more people use ReGenesis, the better off our families, communities, organizations, and ecosystems. That's the business we're in.

---

| Coaching platforms | $100-500+/month, per-coach | Radically affordable, per-coachee for enterprise |
| Enterprise software | "Contact sales" | Transparent pricing, no games |

# PART P: LEGAL & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

## Coaching vs. Therapy: Legal Distinction

| Factor | Licensed Therapy | Coaching |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| State Licensing Required | Yes - all 50 states | No - unregulated |
| HIPAA Applies | Yes (usually) | No (unless part of health plan) |
| Confidentiality Legally Protected | Yes - by state law | No - only contractual |
| Mandatory Reporting Laws (Tarasoff) | Yes | Not directly |
| Can Diagnose/Treat Mental Conditions | Yes | No - prohibited |

**Key Insight:** Coaches are NOT legally bound by Tarasoff/duty-to-warn laws. However, ethical best practice is to have clear policies anyway.

**If Coach is Also Licensed Therapist:** They remain bound by their professional obligations even when "coaching."

## Mandatory Reporting Policy (Recommended)

During coachee onboarding, present clear disclosure:

```
YOUR DATA, YOUR CONTROL

Your conversations with ReGenesis are private and belong to you.

✓ COMPLETE PRIVACY FROM EMPLOYER
  Even if your organization pays for ReGenesis, they NEVER have
  access to your session content, notes, or AI conversations.
  They only see that you're an active user.

✓ YOU CONTROL WHAT YOUR COACH SEES
  You can redact any conversation with the AI companion before
  your coach sees the summary. Your coach only sees what you approve.

✓ ENCRYPTION & SECURITY
  All data encrypted in transit and at rest. [SOC 2 / ISO 27001]

⚠️ IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS (Legal Requirements):
  In rare cases, we may be required to break confidentiality:

  • Imminent risk of serious harm to yourself
  • Imminent risk of serious harm to others
  • Suspected child abuse or elder abuse (where legally required)
  • Court order or legal subpoena

  If any of these apply, we will work with your coach to ensure
  your safety and comply with legal requirements.

By continuing, you acknowledge you understand these policies.
```

## Employer-Sponsored Coaching: Data Protection

**The Question:** If a company pays for an employee's ReGenesis subscription, do they own the data?

**Our Position:** No. The architecture makes employer access impossible.

**How We Enforce This:**
1. **Independent service structure** — Not part of health plan
2. **Direct contract with employee** — Even if employer pays
3. **Architectural separation** — Employer only sees aggregate usage metrics
4. **Zero-knowledge encryption** — Employer never has technical access to content
5. **Clear Terms of Service** — Data belongs to user, not employer

**Compliance Considerations:**
- **CCPA (California):** Employees have rights to access, delete, correct data
- **HIPAA:** Only applies if structured as part of health plan (we avoid this)
- **State biometric laws (BIPA):** Relevant if using voice/facial recognition

## Outstanding Legal Questions (Needs Attorney Review)

1. Jurisdiction for international users (GDPR, PIPEDA)
2. Specific Terms of Service language for employer-paid subscriptions
3. E&O insurance requirements for AI-generated advice
4. State-by-state coaching regulation trends
5. Subpoena resistance architecture
6. Third-party data (spouse, boss, colleague) — consent implications
7. Voice cloning consent requirements (future feature)
8. AI liability for coaching advice
9. Cross-border data transfer (EU to US)
10. Biometric data regulations (if using voice/face for auth)
