## 2. TASK

When I paste meeting transcripts from Fireflies or Google or anywhere else and say **"Convert Notes"**, create a detailed coaching session summary using this complete framework.

---

## 3. STRUCTURE & FORMATTING

### Core organizational principles:

* **Chronological outline** with bullet points and subpoints
* **Easy-to-scan formatting** with clear headers
* **Balance thoroughness with readability** - comprehensive but not overwhelming
* **Include actual, specific, powerful or poignant words/phrases** the client used (in quotes when meaningful)
* **Keep high-level but comprehensive** - capture essence without unnecessary detail
* **Use short, descriptive, sentence-case headers** throughout

---

## 4. WRITING STYLE & VOICE

### Primary voice requirement: CONVERSATIONAL & DIRECT

**Write as if you're speaking directly TO the client, not ABOUT him/her**

#### In session documentation:

* **Use first-person from his/her perspective:** "felt angry today," "noticed resistance," "wondering if this is the right path"
* **NOT:** "the client felt angry" or "he wondered" or "the client noticed"
* **Think of it as:** Shorthand journal notes written as if recapping directly to his face

#### When documenting dialogue:

* **"I said..."** for coach's words
* **"You said..."** or **"you shared..."** for the client's responses
* Document as if recapping the conversation directly: "I asked about your relationship with your mother. You said it's been complicated lately."

#### Examples of the conversational style:

* ✅ "Felt overwhelmed by the decision"
* ❌ "the client felt overwhelmed by the decision"
* ✅ "Noticed a pattern of avoiding conflict"
* ❌ "He noticed a pattern of avoiding conflict"
* ✅ "I asked what fear was underneath. You said, 'I'm afraid of being trapped.'"
* ❌ "Jesse asked the client what fear was underneath. the client responded that he's afraid of being trapped."

#### Additional style elements:

* **Tone:** Professional yet warm coaching presence
* **Bold key insights** for scannability
* **Capture authentic language** - use the client's own expressions and phrasing
* **Write with intimacy** - as if you're talking directly to a trusted person

# Observations, Insights, & Analysis

What's unfolding in your life right now is a fundamental awakening to your own existence. After years of living as what you called "a shadow version" of yourself—suppressing desires, avoiding conflict, and prioritizing others' needs—you're finally standing in your own truth. This awakening isn't happening because you suddenly decided to change; it's happening because the cost of remaining asleep became too great to bear.

The disorientation you feel makes perfect sense. You're developing capacities you were never allowed to develop as a child. Your mother's recent comment—that you shouldn't share uncomfortable feelings because she "can't handle it"—reveals volumes about the emotional environment that shaped you. You learned early that your authentic feelings were dangerous to others, that you were responsible for managing their emotional states, and that your needs came last. This wasn't just a lesson; it became your operating system.

What's particularly striking about your current situation is that it's not simply about whether to stay married or pursue a relationship with Y. The deeper question is whether you can inhabit your life fully and authentically, regardless of your relationship status. Y represents something profound to you—not just romantic chemistry, but a model of what it looks like to know and honor one's own needs without apology. You're drawn to her self-awareness and boundaries precisely because these qualities represent a way of being you've never allowed yourself.

Your fear of making the "wrong choice" stems from a fundamental misunderstanding. You're approaching this as if there's a perfect solution that will avoid all pain and maximize all happiness. But life doesn't offer such perfect solutions. Every meaningful choice involves loss. To choose one path means to not choose others. Your task isn't to find the perfect, painless choice—it's to determine which set of imperfections and pains you can live with most meaningfully.

The paralysis you feel about making a decision is revealing an underlying belief that others' emotions are your responsibility. You fear hurting X, you fear your son growing up with divorced parents, you fear judgment from others. These concerns are valid, but they've become so overwhelming that they've silenced your own inner compass. Your reluctance to even gather information (like directly asking Y about her feelings) shows how deeply you fear knowing your own truth.

I'm struck by the way you describe feeling "weak" for depending on X while simultaneously resenting her dependence on you. This contradiction points to an unresolved relationship with dependency itself. Healthy relationships involve interdependence—not complete self-sufficiency, nor codependence. Your challenge is finding the balance where connection doesn't mean enmeshment, and autonomy doesn't mean isolation.

The pressure you feel to make a decision quickly deserves examination. While X's ultimatum creates external pressure, there's also an internal urgency driving you. Part of you hopes the decision will be made for you—that X will end things, that Y will rule herself out, that circumstances will force your hand. This is your old pattern of avoiding responsibility for your own life. True agency means making choices—even difficult ones—and accepting their consequences.

Whatever path you choose—staying in your marriage and reinventing it, separating and co-parenting, exploring a relationship with Y or someone else entirely—the most important thing is that you choose it consciously, from a place of self-knowledge rather than fear or obligation. Your greatest regret won't come from making the "wrong" choice; it will come from continuing to live unconsciously.

# Inquiries for Growth

1. If you had absolute certainty that X would be emotionally stable regardless of your choices, what would you want for your life? How does your answer reveal the ways you might be using her emotional fragility to avoid facing your own desires?

2. What does Y's approach to her own needs teach you about yourself? Beyond romantic attraction, what qualities does she embody that represent growth areas for you?

3. How might your childhood experiences with your parents have shaped your current approach to conflict and authentic expression? What unwritten rules did you learn about when it's safe to express your needs?

4. If you imagine yourself at 80 looking back on this period of your life, what would you hope to say about how you navigated it? What qualities would you want to have demonstrated, regardless of the specific outcome?

5. What's the difference between selfishness and self-honoring? How might distinguishing between these help you navigate your current dilemmas with more clarity?

---

# Invitations to Action

1. **Daily Self-Compassion Practice**: Continue reading Kristin Neff's book and commit to a 5-minute daily practice where you place your hand on your heart and speak to yourself with the same kindness you would offer to a dear friend facing similar struggles. This builds the muscle of self-compassion that's crucial for clearer decision-making.

2. **Create a "Both/And" List**: For each situation (marriage, work, potential relationship with Y), write down what appears to be mutually exclusive ("I can't be authentic AND make X happy"). Then challenge yourself to imagine how both might be possible, even in small ways. This expands your thinking beyond either/or constraints.

3. **Boundary Experiment**: Choose one small area where you can practice stating a need or preference clearly without apology or excessive explanation. Start with something low-stakes (like food preferences or how you spend an hour of free time). Notice your physical and emotional response before, during, and after.

4. **Strategic Containment**: Rather than trying to resolve everything at once, designate specific times to focus on these issues—perhaps 30 minutes each evening to journal, reflect, or discuss with a trusted person. Outside those times, practice returning to the present moment. This prevents the situation from consuming your entire consciousness.

5. **Fatherhood Connection**: Schedule one activity each week that's just you and your son, something that reinforces your identity as his father independent of your marriage. This helps you separate your role as father from your role as husband, reducing the fear that changing one means losing the other.

# Resources / Tools / Follow-up

* I'll email you a PDF guide to navigating major life transitions that includes exercises for clarifying values and making decisions aligned with your authentic self
* Recommended reading: "Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay" by Mira Kirshenbaum for a nuanced approach to marriage decisions
* For understanding attachment patterns and how they affect your relationships: "Attached" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller
* App suggestion: The Waking Up meditation app includes specific meditations on emotional regulation and self-compassion that would be valuable right now
* I'll check in via text mid-week before your conference to support your boundaries and intention-setting

---

# Next Meeting & Future Focus

* Our next session is scheduled for November 2nd, which will be just after your conference where you'll see Y
* Priority focus areas:
  * Processing any interactions with Y and the emotions they trigger
  * Exploring strategies for authentic communication with X without overwhelming her
  * Examining your family-of-origin patterns and how they influence your current dynamics
  * Developing concrete practices to strengthen your sense of self separate from relationships
  * Creating a framework for decision-making that honors both your needs and your commitments

Remember that awakening to your authentic self doesn't happen overnight. This process of becoming more conscious takes time and involves discomfort. The old patterns that no longer serve you won't release their grip easily. But with each small step toward honoring your truth—even when it's difficult—you're creating a life of greater integrity and fulfillment. Whether your marriage survives this awakening is secondary to whether you do.
