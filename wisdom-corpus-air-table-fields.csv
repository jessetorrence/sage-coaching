The Society of Singularities (Eng. trans.),,Andreas Reckwitz,,,,,,,,,,,2017,,,,,"Andreas Reckwitz argues that late-modern societies have shifted from a logic of generality and standardization to a regime of singularities, where goods, persons, experiences, and places are valued as unique and authentic. He shows how this singularization underpins cultural capitalism, digital platforms, and urban attention economies, and reconfigures class structure into a new middle class, an old middle class, a precariat, and an elite. The book analyzes how singularities are produced and valued through curation, staging, and ratings, and examines resulting ambivalences such as intensified inequality, exhaustion, and backlash in the form of right‑wing populism.
