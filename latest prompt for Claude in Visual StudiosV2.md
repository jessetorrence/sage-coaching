amzing. a few small edits to incorproate in a v3 master doc please:  
1\. we're most likely not goign to use Sage as a nmae b/c of all th reaosn ou found in your research. Instead it will be eitehr Regenesis or Lumina.  
2\. in workflow 1 autdrafitn seession notes, the FIRST section of theat 5 (actually 6part) deftult template flow of notes shoule be somethign like the basic session flow (liek what was said... here we want a careful balance between not too muhc/not too little detail. Even though the users is going to be able to adjust that quite easily based on their preferences, both the Kočí starting with him or her and the coach to make it shorter less, etc. etc. the default template should also try to strike a careful balance between too much and two little detail basically capturing all the core main ideas of what was spoken, especially by the Kochi, but not a back-and-forth dialogue otherwise there's no use we might as well just send them the full transcript. We want this to be concise and tight and more like capturing core ideas breakthroughs inside, and key phrases and actually verbatim, quotations by each party, especially the Kochi wherever most irrelevant, but without getting so lost in the weeds that it takes them a year to read that part of the notes. So the basic ideas they need to understand what happened to have a recollection of the things I talked about with you know, outline bullet point style very easy to read as at a glance and scanningit, but not lost in the weeds and then you have the other sections that are fine. Oh, final piece really critical for the architecture of how these notes are laid out I would like them to be accordion style sort of nested I guess is the word so that you have high-level summary and then key sections and key ideas or whatever and all the way down as you click on each level, click click click. It opens up more detail. Click on that opens up more detail. Click on that. It actually open up all the way to thein the recording and especially for the video recording that's held for. Let's say one to two weeks. it'll take him to that exact spot in the actual video and audio recording. So it's like in a sense sort of sore sighting but starting with very high-level moving down to detail as the un click click click the accordion nested style Presen  
3\. Also on this, even though this is for the master document, I think it's critical to update this feature, or I should say include this feature and a slightly updated version of the responses that I sent to the team which we did together right before this document updating. So remind me, please to go back to that so we can update that set of responses for them. The gap analysis response. The same principle applies, and therefore the same feature should be available for the digest/summary of the AI/sage – Coache conversations which the coach gets a summary of in their T \-15 prep in other words they're gonna have a long bunch of conversations, the coach isn't gonna wanna spend the time or have the time to read all that with the Coach. He talked about with the AI chat bought between sessio. They do as a coach need to understand the basis of what happened, but we need to allow on the capability to drill down into the actual details, so high-level summary key, bullet points, etc., about all those things that transpired and we talked about, but then the ability to again and nested or accordion style fashion. Click click, click drilled down and see more at a glance all the way down to the exact conversation that happened. All this, of course, is preface with the fact that the Kochi c choose to eliminate or redact. I should say not make visible everything that they talk about with AI we wanna make sure they have a safe space even away from the coach the coach, I mean that where they can say anything and everything beyond what they would even say to their coach cause as much as they trust their coasters still things they're embarrassed to admit make sure this is really clear in the features and the overall like privacy and security tears that we talked about before updating, and including this both in the master document and in the features gap analysis document which we will update as well

Also, this is just occurring to me now I'm not sure we made it explicit, but the coach obviously needs an app version of this entire platform on their phone and one of those features of course should be able to to interact and respond in every way possible just like they were on their main computer screen dashboard, although adapted for mobile course, and when the coach is randomly thinking of something relate to their client like a need they have or oh I forgot to bill them or cash. Can you check on this blah blah? The chat bar function will be available on their app just like a ChatGPT or Claude and can open up that screen on their phone or get the task done for them and let them know that it's done. It can also log random thoughts or ideas oh gosh, I remembering I'm realizing or this would be a great book for Sarah's coaching when we meet ag or can you please send this to Sarah in a text or something or please log this in her account or hear something for our private note section on her client page. That kind of thing it should be able to easily interact with the entire platform via their ph

For the dashboard section underneath at the bottom should be a summary of the coach's main goals and top priority task across every area of life that they articulated with clickable links that help them take action on those top. Priorities whether it be called the Plumber or plan the anniversary trip with their wife or whatever get their health check up so again, it helps the coach just like the coach E truck all areas of life and execute task on them as much as possible genetically through AI agents if not themselves it should basically distill out anything and everything that can be done and delegate any and all of it to the AI agent, and only the things that cannot be done by the agent and can only be done by the coach then let them do that or in the case of the coach E for the coach he let them do only the things that they can

It helps I'm gonna attach an early rendering of some website wire frames to draw out for inspiration again. My knees are very old and outdated by now and they are simply used as a rough guide to inform you thinking and give you more ideas to help but this was some thoughts I had when we were first thinking about an actual website, even though the website now is gonna be very much back sort of behind the scenes and it has its functionalities and places, but the primary tool is gonna be the extension and it pulls up certain screens when we need it. This is just to give a bit more flesh on the bones for what the actual web screen/website part of our platform looks li the thinking, and principles and functionality that we want should be derived from our latest documents of conversations not from these renderings that I'm gonna attach. The renderings are simply to fill in any blanks or give you inspiration or a better visual for how the website part of our platform should look. If you have any questions about any of it, please ask, and please go through them very very thoroughly. Here is file pathay. Please read EVERTYHGIN In all the folders, but PRIORITIZE NOT the hand drawings/pictures and NOT the Claude rednerings (in the "Claude" subfolder) but instead the ChatGPT folder and evertygin in it..but read allof ti to have a full handle on my EARLY (now mostly outdated) thining about the wbsite layout.. Again, the ideas to use as simply as inspiration and helpful stuff to put more meat on the bones wherever you see in there the latest created Chachi TP derived/created versions of the dashboard and other pages that's what you should prioritize and listen to. And still, after all that the main Main driving hierarpriority should be things we have most recently talked about in our latest master document to make sure that guides everything but you can use the other old stuff as inspiration all makes sense.

For work for workflow four: yes we want that inconspicuous prompt bar at the top of the screen just under the camera, but I should clarify that when you're asking things and it says, for example, hey, would you like me to show you a nice delegation framework or summary document the best practices for Jim to have that hard conversation with his boss, and you say yes it will open up another window also invisible to the Co E on the side of the screen so the coach can read that stuff and see a bigger picture cause some of the stuff that it lays out is quite complex and large will probably need to experiment this a little bit, but we need to do it somewhere that's inconspicuous quick and easy doesn't distract the coach too much during the session, but that can reveal more information and of course the box it opens up can easily be changed in terms of size or location and dragged across the screen and resized re-shaped instantly with the clicker or the cursor I mean

I think I cover this already above, but just in case this is the section where we'd want that nested type of data structure where they can get deeper and deeper more and more detailed data about what the coach E talked about with the 24 seven chat box. In the sction" Workflow 5: 24/7 Coachee Companion (Future Vision)"

Make sure the coaching control panel or whatever is part of a larger settings webpage where the user at whatever level can really find tune and adjust everything in a very user-friendly intuitive way and it needs to be extremely through. I don't think we flushed this out enough so that they get a sense of how they can adjust the settings. I think what's important thing is it visually can see all the settings there if they want to I need to open it up like old-faspage style, but through the command, prompt bar, floating intelligence thing the other present, you know agent, they can just verbally say what they want changing their settings. Have it confirm that and then it automatically logs it and changes in their settings instead of having to go to like multiple layers of bullshit like you have to do when you change something in Zoom, for example, I usually can't even fucking find it and you have to get on ChatGPT or Google to figure out how to change the settings and then you finally change it Jesus Christ that's a ridiculous loop instead just hey I want this change in my preferences. I don't know where the fuck it is or where it is, but please go do it. Confirm you've done it and then you can even show me on  so again this kind of dual reality where you have the full view of different things where they can see it all laid out in front of them and they can just talk to it and tell them what they want changed at every level but the types of things we want to be able to change and set their preferences on I think should be much more thorough. I don't think we've met that out enough. Please do your best to map that out thoroughly and incorporate all this other stuff I've just said.

Once all an important note: I think in any of the communications that are sent out, I should say that are drafted by the AI agent but approved by the coach well actually any communication any kind I should be a very subtle but clear sorry in unintrusive, but clear indicator for the C whether this was you know you could say something like AI but approved by the coach or directly from the coach without the AI or AI only just so there's full transparency in the Coach. He knows oh this is like independent stuff that came just from the AI Coach was not in the loop and that can be OK for certain things especially at a certain level of trust or when the chat bought is fully functional. And it's fully independ but for a lot of other things, it might be nice as a Kochi receiving a message to know hey even though the AI drafted this which we would wanna stay with full transparency, my coach did actually see it and edit/approve it before it was sent. I think that makes him feel more connected to the coach more of an authentic relationship. there are human please leave this into the requirement/features and anything else when we draft re-draft the two documents again, the master doc and the feature gap analysis response doc

Under tier 3, somethings occurring to me we should address: based on the best Legal research and consultation and best practices here with therapy and coaching although I think the rules are a bit different for therapy versus coaching. We should really clarify in the on boarding process, there should be articulation to the coach that something like you know Len where their answers or data are will will alert a coach for example you know so they don't so they can still protect their data. I'd really don't wanna share this my coach you know please keep it redacted and only between you and me the AI something like I'm having an affair or you know I killed my neighbor's dog or something you know bad but not you know completely illegal or suicidal. But they should know that hey if you are articulating to me, the AI, thoughts of suicide basically harming yourself or someone else I am legally reported legally required to share with a coach just so they know, and then you can decide what to do together something like that whatever the best practice and current legal knowledge you have please apply it here and suggest an approach that we should take and include retroactively in the language and questions we use an on boarding process for the user at every level I guess most importantly between the coach E and the coach yeah basically the use the user level as a coach E informing them of this sort of policy we have that were legally bound to report certain things and be careful here, if not report it then at least to be aware of it. The whole principle is that the coach knows when and where and how their data will be shared or not, and they have complete control over it up until the point of some kind of legal requirement to share things like in our risk of self harm harming others or themselves that's pretty important we would want some like kid who's or a person who's admitting they're about to do a massacre of 50 people their school for that to go unreported there has to be action taken legally. So anyway draw from everything you know and this topic and layoutthe Best advice and integrated into our revised docume. Be great to see your thinking and suggested answers here before we integrate th

for the Video retention section I would maybe add an extra notification not just 48 hours but again 20 hours before maybe even a third one right before the deletion just to make sure they're willing and ready to delete the video recording. this is the section I"m talkgin about " Coachee receives notification 48 hours before deletion with option to download"

I'm thinking too about the knowledge, encryption and levels of security so that we can ensure that a corporation does not have a legal right to access ever a Cochise data, I'd like you to as a sidetrack just do some deep research on what exactly the loss says by country and by state if it varies, so we're not promising something we can't deliver. For example, if a company is an employee of that place during the time when the company sponsors or pays for the ReGenesis/sage subscription does that mean they actually own the data in my opinion it definitely shouldn't but we need to double check that this is true. Make sure it's water tight legally and that if challenging a court of law, the coaches cannot be forced to share their data. Again, we need to respect law that might say hey if there's a record of someone planning a murder and attack or whatever to their AA agent, it actually needs to be shared and legally that it should be the case in my opinion, but we need a differentiate clearly like extreme cases like this and again make that clear to a client perhaps sorry to a user/Coach E somehow now on boarding process like we're protecting you completely completely complete. Here's with the loss says here's a we can actually physically architecturally comply with here are extreme cases. He still should be aware of like if you're you know, indicating self harm or harming others you know we're required to report it either to the coach and or to the authorities I think that's the right method again ground this in the best research you can both legally and in terms of coaching and therapy, best practices and produce a full report separate from all this we're working right now when we're done with all the edit notes here. We gotta make sure we're legally compliant basically but not under or over promising the Coach E, how and when their data can be protected otherwise protecting it to the hilt and less public safety, is you know at risk or something like that?

for the insight hierarchy section I think this is pretty much perfect, but just to make sure can you triple check and do a deep dive scan of my coaching transcript to notes conversion prompt to which outlines so well everything I want basically concluded and has been user tested a lot with a bunch of my clients intends to produce really powerful inside observations insights analysis, etc. so make sure nothing conceptionally is missing from there. Tell me if you don't have access to that still it should be somewhere in our files.

this pattern across sessions piece is amazing critical. I think you're basically implies, but it might be worth articulating a little bit more clearly or deeply that if the coach or coach wants to understand where that pattern or observation inside is coming from the AI could quickly generate a list of the instances even tagged by you know the session date when they said it or the documents or data that is pulling from in a way that's really easy to read again kind of nested outline bullet point form that shows them at a glance and allows them to drill down to whatever layer they want including the actual precise quote on whatever date they said it or the you know number of times they posted on Facebook XYZ basically to understand why this thing is making this observation which the coach might not always agree with. Basically presents the data and argument in a collaborative friendly way that the client sorry Kochi can confirm themselves.

and wisdom corpus part instead of calling it simply precision retrieval, which I think is more of a feature than it kind of exclamation it's core value or function. It might be better to call something like you know, Tad support or inside or something some they captures the idea that the reason this feature number one aspect number one is important cause out of all the vast territory of human wisdom and experience captured across all kinds of media and formats, and you know from poetr music or whatever across the centuries and cross cultures, it can suggest what might be most helpful in whatever precise moment for whatever type of client. and for the second part, integrated wisdom yes that's fine. He might extend that definition or description you know to something like it has all that wisdom so that I can do what as a 24 seven Chatbot support both to the coach and the coach and basically can ask much more powerful questions find much more powerful insights and observatiosuggest more powerful resources but all that shit but just chill out the main thing here in terms of the outcome and impact it, it can have with us all knowing all Wize entity that knows deeply about the entire range of human experience and all that we've gathered so far from across the ages and centuries and cultures to you know basically live a better human life individually and collectively, and as a planet.

I think we already talked about the stuff above, but since it appears here again, make sure there's an additional section which will now become section one pushing all the other sections down by one number, to simply recap what was talked about in the session whatever you call that that will be now section one and that there will be a total of six.

also in the wisdom corporate section it's a little bit confusing for me how it's presented and I don't see anywhere the overarching kind of 16 main knowledge domains that we will be using and pulling from or populating. I should say curating. Can you include that somehow we've it end at the right place in this section and then to present it a bit a bit more in intelligible fashion this you know 75 to 100 is confusing like is it 75 or 100 basically I think what we need to see is like here arein these various domains that we think you know eventually all will be relevant the most most important ones that apply to you know MVP zero testing, etc. are this are these you know it's probably gonna be coaching, coaching, psychology, psychology, and general or whatever basically human growth frameworks, etc. and then like just list the books in order of priority with the most important 50, then the next most important you know 50 then the next most important 50 and the next most important I don't know all the way down to the first most important 500 for example I think we should go that far so that if it's easier than we think we can go ahead and have an MVP phase whatever version that really is quite well trained on a lot of books might even be good to have the first 1000, but I don't wanna get too far out of ourselves anyway present this summer in a little bit more logical fashion and grounded all in the 16 domain areas if you can somehow..

Also for this wisdom corporate section and the tagging structure and anything else related to it, please see this latest download will not latest and it's not the most comprehensive but it's a version of a Air table database of my first 1000 works which the one I share with you before which we had the my brothers name, Jenner and the title somewhere and is the full comprehensive list of books, this one is important because it lists all of the fields that I have determined so far at least are important which basically like tags or Mehta tags and it will inform and help you think through or see your thinking much more clearly wwhat we wanna know about each of these books and why and how to apply specifically to any particular coaches needs. So basically just read this thoroughly and understand it Inc. you're thinking and then find a version of this to incorporate and reflect here. You know obviously need to share all this but the way we think about tagging these books or the way they're gonna be tagged and understood in a knowledge graph will be vital so update all your thinking based on this and if needed in this section around wisdom corpus, you can update things here is the file pathway for this. 

When you start the technical part, make absolute sure that somewhere in the early phases in the very very first demo we want to do we want to be able to integrate back end with not just the two most common email platforms, which is I guess Gmail and Outlook, but also the most common document storage placeswhich I guess would be you know Google Drive, which includes basically Google you know, docs and Google sheets, but I don't know Call Google Drive for now and dropbox, and I don't know wherever things are typically stored in an Outlook/corporate environment give basically a top two or three most important and most popular use platforms that we need to integrate w apply the same principle across all the other types of things you know, communication, data, storage/databases, etc. so that we're not overwhelming us here in V0 MVP but that we're covering our basis when we show a corporate test case user like Terry or an individual well at least the raw basic level be able to quickly integrate with their most important you know platforms that they use and of course update the technical specs and phasing all that based on this if it's not already there

under theAI/LLM Architecture setion I could be wrong debate me if I'm not, but I really think that Claude should be our default large LM to do the powerful deep dive work of the session note summaries, observations, insights analysis, etc., because I've seen it in action many many times with hunters are well with many of clients sessions and it's beautiful eloquent, etc.. I think we should stick with Claude for that. I'm happy to use it for other things as well but let's debate this and thought Partner really explore I haven't tried out ChatGPT enough to know so it might be as good or better but my gut sense is that Chachi is more of the workhorse to go do functional things and what not and Claud maybe that's true maybe not but Claude is definitely effective at beautiful, poetic, powerful, almost spiritual soul, level coaching, and I wanna make sure that's retained.if you agree on this, and we conclude with that, then it's critical that that is updated all the way through every document that we pushed to the team, both the master dock here for general purposes and the feature gap analysis so that they are not going down the wrong path using Chachi TP for things they should actually be using Claud for. Also, I don't know if it belongs here in this section or subsection but I'm curious your recommendations or what the team has already suggested in their tech of documents and specs on the Best LLM or LLM's and the various ways you create agents in multi agents or whatever to do the wisdom corpus layer. I don't know how that works technically but it shouldn't be articulated here that you know the basic functions for all the different things on the ReGenesis platform are run by the certain LM's but then we use a llama three or a different smaller model or whatever to do the rag retrieval, etc. to the or or with the/from the wisdom corpus? I'm completely ignorant about their best approach, but help me think through this and provide your best suggestions that I can sign off on and then integrate with the new documents versions.

Again in the section, we need to make sure we add Outlook and whatever the main you know data storage database type thing that would be used by McKinsey or Microsoft might be."Confirmed Integration Targets (For Jesse Test Case"

OK, that's all I have for now. I know it's a lot. Can you really methodically 100% triple checking all these read it line by line and basically then need you to do two things any dialogues you and I need to have to suss out a few details, let's do it now thing to launch a separate research project after we do all this I suppose on the stuff I mentioned before around legal restraints, constraints context, etc., for client data protection like if they're gonna you know murder somebody we need to know that that kind of thing. And then eventually, when we get answers all this, I guess we need that of course final thing real task is very soon then update the two documents the overarching main Vision dock, which is amazing as it is it just needs to be updated and then the features gap analysis response document that I'm gonna send to the team so they can know exactly where to start building the features.
